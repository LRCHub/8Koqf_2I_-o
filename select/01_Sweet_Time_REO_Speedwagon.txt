Sweet time
Reo speedwagon
When i awaken
Feelin no pain
Visibly shaken
Waitin to touch you again
My temperature's risin
But i'm fallin a bit behind
And that ain't so surprising
We're gonna take our own sweet time
Baby we can take our own sweet time
And spend it when we want to
Cus it's yours and mine
Let our love come easy and we fin
We can make it
And we'll take our own sweet time
I know when i hold you
It's a feelin i can't explain
But i never told you
I couldn't take it again
But now i am ready
I am ready to make you mine
So i'm holdin steady
And we're gonna take our own sweet time
Baby we can take our own sweet time
And spend it when we want to
Cus it's yours and mine
Let our love come easy and we find
We can make it
And we'll take our own sweet time
(Repeat)
Baby we can take our own sweet time
And spend it when we want to
Cus it's yours and mine
Let our love come easy and we find
We can make it
And we'll take our own
We can make it
And we'll take our own
We can make it
And we'll take our own sweet time
