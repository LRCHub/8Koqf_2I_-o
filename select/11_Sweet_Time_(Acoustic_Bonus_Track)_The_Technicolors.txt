Last night I just about took your hand
I wish I would
You see the brilliance of where you stand
And I wish you could
You could
I wish you could

After all
Its alright if you dont quite believe me
But only if you come a little closer to me
And find a will to be free

If youd hold your breath then maybe youd see
Im right here waiting to breathe
So go and take your sweet time

You can follow me and wait for the bells to ring
But let me tell you it will be a while
Til you realize just what I think
Cause I think you could
So take me if you please
Yeah I think you should

And after all
Its alright if they dont quite belive me
But only if youd come a little closer to me
And find a will to be free

If youd hold your breath then maybe youd see
Im right here waiting to breathe
So come a little closer to me
We found a will to free

If you hold your breath
Then maybe youd see Im right here waiting to breathe
So go and take your sweet time
