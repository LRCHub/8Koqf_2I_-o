Last night I just about took your hand
I wish I would
You see the brilliance of where you stand
And I wish you could
You could
I wish you could

After all
It's alright if you don't quite believe me
But only if you come a little closer to me
And find a will to be free

If you'd hold your breath then maybe you'd see
I'm right here waiting to breathe
So go and take your sweet time

You can follow me and wait for the bells to ring
But let me tell you it will be a while
Til you realize just what I think
Cause I think you could
So take me if you please
Yeah I think you should

And after all
It's alright if they don't quite belive me
But only if you'd come a little closer to me
And find a will to be free

If you'd hold your breath then maybe you'd see
I'm right here waiting to breathe
So come a little closer to me
We found a will to free

If you hold your breath
Then maybe you'd see I'm right here waiting to breathe
So go and take your sweet time
