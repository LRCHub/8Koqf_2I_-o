The child I was
Counting the days
'til the summer would come
But you don't live forever
Your mother will one day
bring you home
And I feel so stupid,
'cause I wasn't scared of
this before
But since I met you,
I don't wanna die no more
So take a long time
'Cause, oh, the world is lucky
to be your home, I know
I need a next life
'Cause I'm not satisfied to know
you just once
So take a long time
Oh, the world is lucky
to be your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know
you just once
To live with dying
Wouldn't you see our world
as dark?
But I won't spend time resenting
the way things are
So take a long time
Oh, the world is lucky to be
your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know
you just once
So take a long time
Oh, the world is lucky to be
your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know
you just once
So take a long time
Oh, the world is lucky to be
your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know
you just once
I won't spend time resenting
the way things are
